# TODO -> Bootstrap Admin Workspace

A workspace which can be used as a template for managing and creating other workspaces suffers from the chicken and egg problem. It needs to be created and populated with values for variables (env or otherwise). 

What these values are is often pretty dependant on what providers are going to be needed in the child/generated workspaces. 

Consider this a template for your template.
